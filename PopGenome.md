# Testing for adaptive introgression

An interesting thing to do with the introgression tracks is to ask whether they have any evidence of adaptive evolution. One way to do this is to compare dN/dS in the introgressed tracks to the rest of the genome.  Also similar with polymorphism stats.  An R package called PopGenome may allow me to do this: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PopGenome/vignettes/Whole_genome_analyses_using_VCF_files.pdf
