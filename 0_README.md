# Macaque_Genomez

This is a repository for the trans-Wallacea macaque genome project.  I plan to document every step of a bioinformatic pipeline.

# Ideas

* Gene flow questions
Is there evidence of gene flow across Wallace's line?  Does it differ between the X and A?  What about between parapatric species on Sulawesi?

* Recombination questions
How correlated are rates of recombination across species? And to rhesus? 
  * Is there a correlation between fstatistics and recombination rates (prediction is a positive correlation if DM incompatibilities exist).

  * Is there a skew of recombination rates along the chromosome? Does correspond with divergence and polymorphism?
